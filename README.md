# Crypto-Clustering-Challenge-
For this project, I will be clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). First, I’ll load and explore the crypto market data to understand its structure. Then, I will normalize the data using `StandardScaler` to ensure the clustering process works effectively. Using the elbow method, I’ll find the optimal value of k for clustering, then apply K-means to group the cryptocurrencies. Afterward, I’ll use PCA to reduce the dataset to three components and perform clustering again, comparing the results. Finally, I’ll visualize the clusters with hvPlot and analyze the impact of reducing features with PCA on the clustering results.
